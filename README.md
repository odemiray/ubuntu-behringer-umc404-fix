# Ubuntu - Behringer UMC 404 Fix
A simple bash script resolving the issue of only rear channels being used in default Ubuntu installation.

Currently working for UMC404HD (should probably work fine with UMC202 or basically any UMC series, but I only tested it with my 404)

## You know any other audio interface with exact solution?

Feel free to open a PR. Might even use folders for manufactorer, if this is a known issue.

## You want to improve the Readme? You tested in <foo> OS and confirm it's working?
Feel free to open a PR and populate the list.
